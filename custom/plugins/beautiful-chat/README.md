# Beautiful Chat

A Paseo plugin that redraws the Oh My Pi (OMP) chat stream: tool calls, reasoning, prompts, approvals,
and checklists. It replaces the host rendering of OMP timeline items with typed, syntax-aware cards
that follow the active Paseo theme.

![A prompt, a tool call, a finished background job, and the reply that closes the turn](images/hero.png)

Every screenshot here is a capture of the real component, rendered by the harness in `.showcase/`.
[One whole turn, top to bottom](images/thread.png) shows the cards in the order the timeline draws
them.

## Install

```bash
paseo plugin install ABorakati/beautiful-chat
```

The manifest requires Paseo `>=0.8.0`. Open **Settings → Plugins → Beautiful Chat** for the
accent, fonts, frosted glass, and prompt bubble options.

## Tool calls

### Shell and Git

Terminal frame, Bash syntax, exit code, duration, and the Git brand mark. A command that prints
nothing says so rather than showing an empty panel.

![Shell and Git tool calls](docs/images/tool-bash.png)

### Read

The file's own language logo, a wrapped path, line numbers, and a copy button. The path is a link:
pressing it shows the file in the machine's file manager.

![Read tool call](docs/images/tool-read.png)

### Images

A read of a `.png` carries no bytes through the timeline, so the host draws it as an empty code
block with a language badge. This card draws the file instead: a picture mark, the path as a link,
the pixel size and file size read from the header, and an eye control that hides the thumbnail. The
bytes come from the plugin's own daemon-side RPC (`file.image`), which is the only side that can
reach the file; PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, AVIF, BMP, ICO and SVG are recognised, and anything past
3 MB reports its size rather than inlining a data URI.

### Edit

Diff rendering where adjacent removed and added rows join into one rounded block, and only the
marker column carries the red or green.

![Edit tool call](docs/images/tool-edit.png)

### Reasoning tool

Live thinking text, a token badge, and numbered steps.

![Thinking tool call](docs/images/tool-thinking.png)

### MCP

Server badge, transport, input parameters, and the response payload, each syntax-highlighted.

![MCP tool call](docs/images/tool-mcp.png)

### Eval

One card per kernel cell: the source that ran, then the text it printed.

![Eval tool call](docs/images/tool-eval.png)

### Ask

Option cards with the recommended badge, the chosen answer marked, and a typed reply labelled as
typed rather than shown as a selection.

![Ask tool call](docs/images/tool-ask.png)

### Task

Subagent name, type, model, and the delegated instructions.

![Task tool call](docs/images/tool-task.png)

### Hub

Every `hub` op is mapped: `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `ps`, `logs`, and `describe` render the
process card with its launch line, readiness, and recent output; `send`, `wait`, `inbox`, and
`list` render the message card; `jobs` and `cancel` render the job snapshot. The cards report;
they carry no buttons, because a plugin cannot restart or cancel anything.

![Hub tool calls](docs/images/hub.png)

### Paseo tools

Paseo's own mark leads the card, and the created agent's provider carries its brand mark.

## Stream components

### Reasoning trace

A collapsible trace with a connected step rail, per-step duration, and a token total.

![Reasoning trace](docs/images/reasoning.png)

### Checklist

Phase name, per-task status, durations, and a blocked task with its reason.

![Checklist](docs/images/tasks.png)

### Approval card

Risk classification, the exact command, target path, working directory, and the approve or deny
actions the host owns.

![Approval card](docs/images/approval.png)

### Prompt bubble

The authored turn on a raised theme surface with a square tail, a copy button, and the turn's token
usage.

![Prompt bubble](docs/images/user.png)

### Syntax block

Shared by every card that shows code: language detection from the path, line numbers, diff tints,
Devicon brand marks, and the file-manager link.

| Enhanced prompt bubble | Off hands prompts back to Paseo, whose bubble shows pasted images. |
| Assistant markdown     | Off hands replies back to Paseo's own markdown renderer.           |

## Finding text

Paseo's own chat find (Ctrl/Cmd+F) cannot reach a prompt or reply this plugin draws (see
[limitation 14](#plugin-sdk-limitations-found-while-building-this)). The plugin therefore takes
Ctrl/Cmd+F on desktop and web and opens its own find bar over the chat. The bar searches
everything the chat has rendered, including tool cards. Enter moves to the next match, Shift+Enter
to the previous one, and Escape closes the bar.

The bar searches only messages the chat has loaded. Scroll up first to include older history.

To keep Paseo's native search, which also searches unloaded history, turn off **Assistant
markdown** and **Enhanced prompt bubble** in **Settings -> Plugins -> Beautiful Chat**. Paseo then
draws replies and prompts itself, and Ctrl/Cmd+F opens Paseo's find instead of the plugin's bar.
New messages follow the change.
Tool, reasoning, and checklist cards keep the plugin's styling, so Paseo's find still cannot reveal a
match inside one of them.

## Opening files

A file name in a read, write, edit, or code block is a link. Pressing it calls the plugin's own
daemon-side RPC (`file.reveal`), which resolves the path against the agent's working directory and
asks the platform shell to show it:

| Platform | Behaviour                                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Windows  | `explorer.exe /select,<file>` selects the file.        |
| macOS    | `open -R <file>` selects the file in Finder.           |
| Other    | `xdg-open <directory>` opens the containing directory. |

A directory path opens that directory. A path the daemon cannot stat does nothing.

## Unmapped output

A tool the plugin has no typed card for still shows its output in the terminal frame, and a call
that printed nothing says so. No card renders an empty panel.

The link cannot open Paseo's own file editor: see the first limitation below.

## Plugin SDK limitations found while building this

Measured against `@getpaseo/plugin` 0.8.0 and the Paseo 0.8.0 desktop build. Each entry names the
evidence and the workaround this plugin uses.

1. **No file navigation.** Timeline renderer props are exactly `{agentId, theme, host, layout,
timestamp, item}`, and plugin navigation offers only `openSettings`, `openSurface`,
   `openWorkspacePanel`, `openAgentPanel`, `openAgent`, and `openWorkspace`. The host's own file tab
   target (`{kind:"file", path}`, reachable in-app through `?open=file:<path>`) is not exposed, and
   the `paseo://` scheme only carries agent deep links. Workaround: a daemon-side RPC that reveals
   the path in the operating system's file manager.
2. **Transformers see a stripped item.** The app maps its stream item to the plugin item before any
   transformer runs, and a user message keeps only `text`, `messageId`, and `clientMessageId`. Pasted
   images never reach plugin code, and the daemon timeline row stores the same item, so a server RPC
   cannot recover them either. Workaround: the **Enhanced prompt bubble** setting returns prompts to
   the host.
3. **Interception is all or nothing.** A transformer replaces the host item completely. There is no
   way to decorate an item or keep host affordances that the plugin does not reimplement. Returning
   `undefined` is the only opt-out.
4. **Transform results are cached per item.** Changing a preference does not re-run transformers for
   items already on screen. New items follow the change; existing ones need a reload.
5. **Renderers get no workspace.** Props carry `agentId` only, so `cwd` and `workspaceId` need a
   second lookup through `useAgent`.
6. **Token usage is live-only.** Usage is not persisted on timeline items, so a turn this client did
   not observe live shows no figures.
7. **RPC names are validated late.** The host requires `^[a-z][a-z0-9._-]*$`. A camelCase name such
   as `revealPath` typechecks, then fails the whole plugin at install or reload with
   `Invalid plugin RPC method`.
8. **The React Native runtime module is a stub in the package.** `@getpaseo/plugin/client/react-native`
   ships as `export {}`; the host injects the implementations. Bundling or testing plugin UI outside
   Paseo needs a shim, which is what `.showcase/shims` provides.
9. **The theme carries six colours.** `PluginTheme` exposes `surface0`–`surface2`, `border`,
   `foreground`, `foregroundMuted`, `accent`, `accentForeground`, and three status colours. Every
   other surface, including code backgrounds and diff tints, must be derived with alpha; that is what
   `client/components/theme-tokens.ts` exists for.
10. **No CSS escape hatch.** React Native styles drop unknown keys, so `backdrop-filter` is
    impossible through the style API. Frosted glass is a hand-injected `<style>` rule matched by a
    data attribute.
11. **No font registration.** Faces are embedded as data URIs in an injected `@font-face` rule, and
    every surface needs a wrapper that escapes the host's own font cascade.
12. **A closed module allowlist, and no SVG renderer.** Plugin client code may import only
    `react`, `react/jsx-runtime`, `react-native`, `@tanstack/react-query`, `zod`,
    `@getpaseo/plugin`, `@getpaseo/plugin/client`, `@getpaseo/plugin/client/react-native`, and
    `@getpaseo/plugin/client/ui`. Anything else throws
    `Module "x" is not available in plugin client code` when the bundle loads, so
    `react-native-svg` and `lucide-react-native` are out of reach. Lucide icons still work,
    because the host renders them: `Icon` from `@getpaseo/plugin/client/react-native` takes any
    Lucide name. Brand marks are not in Lucide, and React Native's `<Image>` decodes PNG, JPEG,
    GIF, and WebP but never SVG, so a data-URI SVG renders on web and stays blank on iOS and
    Android. Those marks ship as PNG rasters in `client/components/mark-bitmaps.ts`.
13. **Settings are host-scoped only.** `defineSettings` rejects any scope other than `host`, so
    per-workspace or per-agent presentation settings are impossible. This plugin keeps presentation
    preferences in client storage instead.
14. **Paseo's chat find cannot reach replaced rows.** Paseo 0.9.1 finds a match by its original
    message id, then waits for a row carrying that id. A transformed row always carries
    `<pluginId>/<itemId>` instead, so Ctrl+F on a styled prompt or reply never reveals the match.
    Workaround: the plugin's own find bar, described in [Finding text](#finding-text).

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
paseo plugin reload beautiful-chat
```

Rebuild the screenshots after a visual change:

```bash
esbuild .showcase/showcase.tsx --bundle --outfile=.showcase/showcase.js --jsx=automatic \
  --alias:react-native=react-native-web \
  --alias:@getpaseo/plugin/client/react-native=./.showcase/shims/plugin-react-native.tsx
```

Then serve `.showcase/` and capture each `#shot-*` element.
